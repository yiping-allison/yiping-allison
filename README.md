<h1 align="center"> Yiping (Allison) Su </h1>

Hello!

I'm Yiping, but I usually go by Allison.

I am an engineering professional with a background in software engineering and economic analysis. I use both experiences to design and develop data-minded applications that support machine learning and artificial intelligence initiatives.

My language of choice is Go, but I also commonly work in Python.
