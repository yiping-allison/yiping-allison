<h1 align="center"> Yiping (Allison) Su </h1>

Hello! I'm Yiping, but I usually go by Allison. I graduated from [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2020.
I'm currently working at Charles Schwab as a software developer.

I am passionate about data and software engineering methods! :chart_with_upwards_trend:

My language of choice is Go, but I also commonly work in Python.
